## Python for Everybody Specialization üíªüêç

This repository contains the code and learnings from the **Python for Everybody Specialization**, a comprehensive series of courses designed to teach programming using the Python programming language. Each course in the specialization focuses on different aspects of programming and data analysis, allowing learners to develop a strong foundation in Python.

### Courses in the Specialization

1. **Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)**: This course introduces the basics of programming computers using Python. It covers the construction of programs using simple instructions in Python, without requiring advanced mathematical knowledge. Upon completion, learners will be prepared to take more advanced programming courses. This course covers Chapters 1-5 of the textbook "Python for Everybody". (Python 3)

2. **Python Data Structures**: This course explores the core data structures of the Python programming language, such as lists, dictionaries, and tuples. Learners will move beyond procedural programming and delve into using these built-in data structures to perform complex data analysis. This course covers Chapters 6-10 of the textbook "Python for Everybody". (Python 3)

3. **Using Python to Access Web Data**: In this course, learners will discover how to treat the Internet as a source of data. They will learn web scraping, parsing, and reading techniques, as well as accessing data through web APIs. The course covers handling HTML, XML, and JSON data formats using Python. Prior familiarity with the material covered in Chapters 1-10 of the textbook and the first two courses in this specialization is recommended. (Python 3)

4. **Using Databases with Python**: This course introduces students to the basics of the Structured Query Language (SQL) and database design. It covers storing data as part of a multi-step data gathering, analysis, and processing effort using SQLite3 as the database. Students will also learn how to build web crawlers and perform basic data visualization using the D3.js library. Prior familiarity with the material covered in Chapters 1-13 of the textbook and the first three courses in this specialization is recommended. (Python 3)

5. **Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python**: The capstone course integrates the knowledge gained from the previous courses in the specialization. Students will build a series of applications to retrieve, process, and visualize data using Python. The course includes hands-on projects and exercises covering all the elements of the specialization. Chapters 15 and 16 from the book "Python for Everybody" serve as the foundation for the capstone. (Python 3)
